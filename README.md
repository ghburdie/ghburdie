- 👋 Hi, I’m **@ghburdie** and ...
 
     I like to program in: **Ruby, R, Bash-Scripting**
- 👀 I’m also using **Python** in some cases (not really a fan of it, but perhaps it will change).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Haskell**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... at the moment: nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I have to consider about it.
